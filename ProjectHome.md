WebME is a CMS written by Webworks, designed for small businesses. The idea behind WebME is that a user would simply create pages and populate them using an RTE (FCKEditor for example).

WebME has a plugin architecture which means that adding new functionality to the CMS is simple. Existing plugins include an image gallery, polls and forms.
